Kwika Events: Concept Note

and Business Outline

1. Overview
Kwika Events is a digital marketplace designed to revolutionise the events industry in Malawi
by providing an end-to-end platform where users can discover, compare, book, and review
event service providers seamlessly. The platform serves as an integrated web-based and
mobile-friendly system that connects event planners, vendors, and customers through
verified listings, transparent pricing, and a smart booking system.
Inspired by platforms like Airbnb, Kwika Events aims to bring structure, trust, and visibility to
a fragmented market currently driven by informal word-of-mouth referrals.

2. Problem Statement
The Malawian events industry faces several pain points that limit its growth and
professionalisation:
1. Informality &amp; Limited Visibility – Most service providers (decorators,
photographers, venues, caterers, etc.) rely on word-of-mouth, making it hard for
customers to discover and compare options.
2. Time-Consuming Search Process – Customers spend excessive time finding and
vetting providers due to the absence of a centralised digital directory.
3. Lack of Verified Information – There’s no standardised platform where service
quality, pricing, and availability are transparent or verified.
4. Fragmented Customer Experience – Booking, payment, and feedback are handled
separately, leading to inefficiency and trust gaps.

3. The Kwika Solution
Kwika Events addresses these gaps by offering a digital ecosystem for event planning,
discovery, and booking.
