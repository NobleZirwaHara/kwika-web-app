You are extending an existing Laravel + InertiaJS + React monolithic application named Kwika.Events.
The database is PostgreSQL. 
Do not rename or recreate tables; infer their structure from existing models and migrations. 
All work must align with Laravel conventions and the business requirements below.


Goal: Complete and extend the marketplace for event service providers using Laravel with Inertia and React components — no API endpoints.

⚙️ Implementation Principles

Framework Pattern: Use Laravel + InertiaJS for all frontend rendering — no REST API routes.

Client-side interactivity should use React components, not a separate API layer.

Data Handling:

Use Eloquent ORM with PostgreSQL for persistence.

File Structure & Convention:

Place controllers in app/Http/Controllers and views in resources/js/Pages.

Place reusable React components under resources/js/Components.

Use existing models and migrations — don’t rename or recreate tables.

Respect established naming patterns and relationships (Claude should infer them).

Security & Validation:

Use Laravel FormRequest validation for all forms.

Use Policies or middleware for ownership and access control.

Use Laravel Breeze (Inertia) for authentication base (multi-guard for providers and staff).

Rate-limit sensitive routes (login, reset password, booking).

UX Standards:

TailwindCSS for styling.

shadcn/ui and Framer Motion for interface polish.

Responsive, mobile-first layout.

Use Inertia partial reloads (only: []) and lazy-loading for infinite scroll sections.

🧩 System Modules and Business Requirements
1. 🧍 Service Provider Management

Purpose: Allow event service providers to register, verify, and manage profiles.

Laravel Implementation:

Extend Laravel Breeze authentication for providers (service_provider guard).

Registration with:

Email or phone verification (Redis temporary storage + Laravel Notifications)

2FA (email/SMS) using pragmarx/google2fa-laravel

Device tracking per login (device hash)

Profile management:

View/edit profile details

Enable/disable 2FA

Reset password

Logout and revoke sessions

Inertia Pages (React):

/register – multi-step form (details + verification)

/login – login with optional 2FA

/dashboard/profile – view and update provider profile

/dashboard/security – manage 2FA, devices, and credentials

2. 🏢 Company Management

Purpose: Each provider can register and manage their companies/brands.

Laravel:

CompanyController handles CRUD and media uploads via Storage::put().

Providers must only access companies they own.

Logo/image upload replaces existing files automatically.

React (Inertia):

/dashboard/companies

/dashboard/companies/create

/dashboard/companies/{id}/edit

Components for logo preview, upload progress, and validation feedback.

3. 📂 Catalogues, Categories, and Services

Purpose: Structure and display offerings by type.

Laravel:

CatalogueController, CategoryController, and ServiceController nested under company routes.

Manage catalogues and services with relationships (companies own catalogues → catalogues own services).

Handle image uploads and cleanup.

Allow optional service “type” or category tags.

React:

/dashboard/catalogues

/dashboard/catalogues/{id}/services

Components:

Category selector

Service card grid

Infinite scroll (lazy loading via Inertia partials)

4. 🎟️ Promotions

Purpose: Providers can promote offers and featured packages.

Laravel:

PromotionController with full CRUD via Inertia.

Auto-hide expired promotions using model scopes or scheduled tasks.

Support filters (name, category, date, location) in queries.

React:

/dashboard/promotions

/promotions (public listing)

Filter sidebar (date, category)

Masonry or grid layout with infinite scroll

5. 🎫 Events & Ticket Packages

Purpose: Enable providers to host and display events.

Laravel:

EventController with Inertia views for create/update/delete.

Store ticket packages as array/JSON.

Validation for name, date, venue, location.

Use Eloquent scopes for filtering by date and venue.

Cache popular events in Redis.

React:

/dashboard/events

/events (public listing)

/events/{slug} – event detail page

Components:

Ticket package selector

Countdown or date badge

6. 🤝 Booking System

Purpose: Facilitate client–provider interactions and bookings.

Laravel:

BookingController for Inertia views:

Client creates booking (pending status)

Provider approves/cancels bookings

Notifications (Laravel Mail & SMS)

Bookings editable by client only while pending.

Redis used for temporary status caching and notifications queueing.

React:

/bookings (client side)

/dashboard/bookings (provider side)

Components:

Booking card

Status badge

Modals for approval or cancellation

7. 🧑‍💼 Staff & Admin Area

Purpose: Internal Kwika.Events management (CMS, staff, analytics).

Laravel:

Separate guard (staff) and models for staff accounts.

Admin and Author roles via Policies.

Manage:

Staff accounts

Content sections

Meta tags, schema markups, social media info

Analytics dashboards (using Redis data)

React (Inertia):

/admin/dashboard

/admin/staff

/admin/content

/admin/analytics

Inline content editors and table layouts.

8. 📰 CMS & SEO

Purpose: Manage dynamic site sections and SEO content.

Laravel:

Models: Section, SectionImage, ContentType, ContentTypeListItem, SchemaMarkup, SocialMetaTag.

Inertia-based CRUD.

Media storage with Storage::disk('public').

React:

Admin page for section listing and editing.

Inline editors for SEO fields (title, description, canonical).

File upload previews for images.

🔄 Shared Behaviors
Component	Requirement
Authentication	Multi-guard (providers & staff) via Laravel Breeze
2FA	Email or phone using pragmarx/google2fa-laravel
Caching	Redis for profile caching, access tracking, and analytics
Notifications	Laravel Mailables + SMS channel integration
Analytics Worker	Scheduled Artisan command to compute provider ranking
File Storage	Laravel Storage facade (public disk)
Error Handling	Inertia shared prop for global error flash
Rate Limiting	Throttle login, password reset, booking submission
🧠 Claude Code Action Plan

When executing this brief, Claude Code should:

Scan the existing Laravel project structure and locate existing controllers, routes, and pages.

Generate or complete missing Laravel controllers using Inertia rendering.

Generate or complete React pages/components matching each Laravel view.

Integrate caching, validation, and authorization logic per the business rules above.

Use existing models, relationships, and migrations — infer table structures automatically.

Register nested web routes using Laravel’s Route::resource() and Route::group() conventions.

Integrate Redis usage for caching, temporary codes, and analytics tasks.

Implement infinite scroll using Inertia partial reloads instead of front-end API calls.

✅ Deliverables

Claude Code should produce or update:

Laravel controllers (Inertia-based) for all modules above

React pages under /resources/js/Pages and UI components under /resources/js/Components

FormRequest validation classes for all forms

Middleware and policies for ownership and access


Updated routes in routes/web.php

View layouts for dashboard and public pages

🚫 Do NOT


❌ Change table or column names (infer and reuse existing).

❌ Modify authentication scaffolding already set up.

❌ Replace current CSS or Tailwind configs.

✅ Only extend the system modularly and intelligently.
